Package graphql implements the graphql specification  that
is yet to  be released.

What it is

What GraphQL currently gives you is an abstract syntax tree after
receiving which you need to figure out how to execute it, an example
of such an application lives at https://sevki.org/g2sd.

More info

Details and the spec of the package are not yet  public, once they are
chances are they will show up here https://sevki.co/2rmgfV.
